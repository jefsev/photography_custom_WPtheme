# photography_custom_WPtheme

Custom made WP-theme for a photography client.

# Wish of the client

Client wanted to have a personal website to upload photos into different categories.
Wordpress was the best choice, so she could upload and remove photos her self.

# What i learned and where to improve.

Learned to use Wordpress and the PHP that comes along with it.
How to make a mobile menu, i still think it can use a upgrade to make it smoother.
Making the website look somewhat good on a phone was a challenge. Here also alot to learn about proper use of @media queries.
Writing clean code and structured properly is something te keep improving.
